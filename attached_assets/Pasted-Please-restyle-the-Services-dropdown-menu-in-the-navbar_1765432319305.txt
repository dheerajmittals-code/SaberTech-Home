Please restyle the “Services” dropdown menu in the navbar so it looks like a polished SaaS / enterprise site, instead of a plain white list.

Keep the same items and links, but improve the DESIGN and POSITION:

1) POSITION & SIZE
- The dropdown should be left-aligned with the “Services” menu item (not floating far away).
- Set a max-width around 260–280px so it looks compact, not huge.
- Add generous internal padding (16–20px).
- Add spacing (10–12px) between each menu item.

2) CONTAINER STYLE
- Background: #ffffff
- Border-radius: 12px
- Box-shadow: soft, e.g. 0 18px 45px rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.12)
- Slight top margin below the “Services” label so it doesn’t touch the navbar.
- Make sure it doesn’t overlap the “Get a Quote” button.

3) ITEM STYLE
Each dropdown item should be a small row with an icon + text:

- Icon on the left (simple line/outline icon), text on the right.
- Icons should use the primary blue color.
- Text style:
  - Service title: medium weight
  - No long descriptions in the dropdown, just the titles.
- Add a subtle separator line between groups if needed (for example between AI Automation and Gig Workforce).

Menu items (same order):
- Customer Support & CX
- Revenue & Inside Sales
- Back Office Operations
- QA & Compliance
- AI Automation
- Gig Workforce (On-Demand)

4) HOVER EFFECT
- On hover over an item:
  - Background: very light blue (#f3f6ff or similar)
  - Text color slightly darker
  - Cursor: pointer
- The icon can slightly change shade on hover.

5) INTERACTION
- Dropdown opens on hover over “Services” (desktop).
- Closes when the mouse leaves the dropdown area.
- Clicking on “Services” itself still goes to /services/index.html.
- On mobile, keep the current tap-to-expand behavior (no hover).

6) CONSISTENCY
- Use the same font as the rest of the site (Inter / Poppins).
- Keep the overall look minimal, clean and professional.
- Do NOT change the layout or style of other navbar items or the hero section – only improve the Services dropdown styling.
