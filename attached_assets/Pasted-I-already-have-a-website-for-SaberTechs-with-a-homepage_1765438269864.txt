I already have a website for SaberTechs with a homepage and a “Customer Support & CX” landing page.
Create a new landing page for the service “Revenue & Inside Sales” following the same design system: same fonts, colors, buttons, spacing, and section style as the Customer Support & CX landing page.
This page must be SEO & SEM friendly and optimized for Google Ads.
Use proper HTML headings (H1, H2, H3), mobile-first layout, and fast-loading markup.
GENERAL STRUCTURE
Use the following sections, in this order:
Hero section
Problem → Solution two-column section
Features / capabilities grid
Metrics / proof strip
Case study
4-step process timeline
Industry use cases
Pricing overview
FAQ
Final CTA banner
Also:
Add internal links to other relevant SaberTechs services (Customer Support & CX, Back Office Ops, QA & Compliance, AI Automation, Gig Workforce).
Add basic SEO meta tags (title & description) for this page.
Make sure all text is readable and high-contrast.
Now fill each section with this exact content:

“3× more qualified leads”
“40% faster follow-ups”
