Create a dedicated, high-conversion landing page for “Customer Support & CX Outsourcing” for SaberTechs.
Use the SAME design system as my current website:
Same navbar and footer (reuse existing)
Same fonts (e.g., Inter / Poppins)
Same button styles and color palette (blue accent)
Same general spacing and card style as my Services page
This landing page is for Google Ads and SEO, so it must be focused on ONE service: Customer Support & CX, with a clear CTA and no distractions.
The page must contain the following sections, in this order:
