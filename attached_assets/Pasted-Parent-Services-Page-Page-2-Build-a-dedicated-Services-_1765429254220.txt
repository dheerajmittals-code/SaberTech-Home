Parent “Services” Page (Page 2)
Build a dedicated “Services” landing page for SaberTechs (services.html).
It should match the design style, colors, fonts, and navbar/footer of my existing homepage.
Do not change the existing navbar or footer – just reuse them.
The layout must be clean, modern, and B2B, with clear sections as specified below.
🔹 SECTION 1 – HERO (Top of Services Page)
Full-width section with light background (white or very light grey).
Centered content (left-aligned on desktop, nicely stacked on mobile).
Content:
Heading (H1):
Operations & CX Services Built for High-Growth Businesses
Subheading (H3):
Flexible, scalable, fully-managed customer support, sales, and back-office operations — designed for global SMBs.
Buttons:
Primary: Book Consultation
Secondary: View Case Studies (placeholder link for now)
Right side:
A simple illustration or icon cluster related to operations / dashboards / teamwork (similar visual style to the homepage hero).
Add comfortable vertical padding (top & bottom ~100–120px).
🔹 SECTION 2 – CORE SERVICE GRID (6 Cards, Expanded)
Add a section title centered:
