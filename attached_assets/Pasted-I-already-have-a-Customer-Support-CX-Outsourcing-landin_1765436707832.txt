I already have a “Customer Support & CX Outsourcing” landing page designed for SaberTechs.
✅ IMPORTANT:
Keep the existing layout, sections, fonts, colors, spacing and buttons exactly as they are.
Do NOT redesign the page. Only update text content and small micro-copy as described below.
This page is used for Google Ads (SEM) and SEO, so keep the structure fast and clean.
Update each section with the following exact copy:
HERO SECTION (top of page)
Keep the same two-column layout and illustration.
Replace the texts with this:
Main H1:
“Build Your Customer Support Team in 7 Days — Without Hiring”
Subheading:
“24/7 chat, email and voice support for SaaS, E-commerce, Travel and EdTech brands — managed end-to-end by trained CX specialists.”
Primary CTA button text:
“Book a Free Consultation”
Secondary CTA button text:
“View Packages & Rates”
Under the buttons, add a small, lighter micro-trust line:
“No long-term contracts · Flexible plans · Fast onboarding”
Keep the trust bullets under the hero but update to:
“98% CSAT”
“70% backlog reduction”
“24/7 coverage”
“SLA-driven workflows”
PROBLEM / SOLUTION SECTION
Keep the layout with the two cards (“The Struggle” and “Our Solution”).
Use this text:
Section title:

Left card – heading:
“The Struggle”
Left card bullets:
“Tickets piling up and customers waiting too long”

Below the two cards, centered, add:
Text: “Want to clear your backlog and improve response times?”

Style that button like your existing secondary buttons.

GENERAL

Keep all headings as proper H1/H2/H3 tags for SEO.
Ensure all new text is responsive and fits nicely on mobile.
Do not add any new pages, only update this existing Customer Support & CX landing page.
