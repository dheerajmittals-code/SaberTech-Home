Update the existing top navigation so that “Gig Workforce” appears INSIDE the Services dropdown menu, not as a separate top-level item.

Current expected structure of the main navbar:
- Home
- Services ▾
- Industries ▾
- Why Us
- Contact
- Get a Quote (button on the right)

1) SERVICES DROPDOWN ITEMS
Inside the Services dropdown, the items should appear in this order:

- Customer Support & CX
- Revenue & Inside Sales
- Back Office Operations
- QA & Compliance
- AI Automation
- Gig Workforce (On-Demand)

Each item should be a clickable link. Use these URLs (placeholders are fine if pages are not built yet):

- Customer Support & CX → /services/customer-support-cx.html
- Revenue & Inside Sales → /services/revenue-inside-sales.html
- Back Office Operations → /services/back-office-operations.html
- QA & Compliance → /services/qa-compliance.html
- AI Automation → /services/ai-automation.html
- Gig Workforce (On-Demand) → /services/gig-workforce.html

2) VISUAL STYLE
- Match the existing dropdown styling (background color, font, padding, hover state).
- On hover over each item:
  - Slight background highlight (light blue or light grey).
  - Text color changes subtly (darker blue).
- Ensure “Gig Workforce (On-Demand)” looks visually identical to the other items (same font size, padding, icon style if icons are used).

3) BEHAVIOR (DESKTOP)
- The Services dropdown should still:
  - Open on hover over “Services”.
  - Close when the mouse leaves the dropdown area.
- Clicking directly on the word “Services” (not an item) should still go to the parent Services page:
  /services/index.html

4) BEHAVIOR (MOBILE)
- In the mobile/hamburger menu:
  - “Services” should expand/collapse to show all 6 sub-items.
  - Include “Gig Workforce (On-Demand)” as the last sub-item in the Services list.
  - All links should remain functional with taps.

5) DO NOT CHANGE OTHER NAV ITEMS
- Keep “Industries”, “Why Us”, “Contact” and the “Get a Quote” button exactly as they are.
- Do not add Gig Workforce as a separate top-level nav item.
- Only modify the Services dropdown content.
