Please update the top navigation to include a professional “Services” menu with BOTH hover-triggered dropdown behavior AND a clickable parent menu item.

Requirements:

==========================
1. NAVIGATION STRUCTURE
==========================
Navigation items:
- Home
- Services ▾
- Why Us
- Industries
- Contact
- Get a Quote (button-style on the right)

==========================
2. SERVICES DROPDOWN (ON HOVER)
==========================
When the user hovers over “Services,” show a dropdown menu with these items:

- Customer Support & CX
- Revenue & Inside Sales
- Back Office Operations
- QA & Compliance
- AI Automation
- Gig Workforce

Each should link to its own individual service landing page.

Design style:
- Light background (#ffffff or #f8f9fb)
- Soft shadow
- Rounded corners (8px)
- Vertical list with spacing
- Hover effect on each item (light blue background + slight lift)

==========================
3. CLICK BEHAVIOR (PARENT PAGE)
==========================
If the user CLICKS on the word “Services” (not the dropdown items), it should open the parent Services page:

URL example:
services.html

This page already exists or will be generated as the full “Services Overview” page containing all 6 offerings in a grid layout.

==========================
4. RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR (MOBILE)
==========================
On mobile:
- The “Services” menu should become a collapsible accordion item.
- Clicking it should reveal the sub-menu items (no hover on mobile).
- The parent “Services” page should still open if the user taps the main label (not the dropdown arrow).

==========================
5. INTERACTION BEHAVIOR
==========================
- Dropdown should open on hover (desktop)
- Dropdown should close when mouse leaves the menu
- Smooth fade/slide animation (150–200ms)
- No jumpy transitions

==========================
6. VISUAL DESIGN
==========================
Match the site’s existing modern SaaS style:
- Font: Inter or Poppins
- Blue accent (#2563eb or similar)
- Minimal, clean, professional

==========================
7. DO NOT CHANGE OTHER SECTIONS
==========================
Only modify the navigation bar and its dropdown behavior.
Keep the rest of the homepage layout exactly as it is.
