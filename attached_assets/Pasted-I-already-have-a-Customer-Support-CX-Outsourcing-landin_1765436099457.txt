I already have a Customer Support & CX Outsourcing landing page designed.
KEEP the current layout, fonts, colors, spacing, and structure exactly as they are.
Just make the following content and micro-UX improvements section by section:
1) HERO SECTION (top)
Keep the main H1 exactly as it is:
“Build Your Customer Support Team in 7 Days — Without Hiring”
Under the two CTA buttons, add one line of reassurance micro-copy in a smaller, lighter font, like:
“No long-term contracts · Flexible plans · Fast onboarding”
Change the secondary button text from “See Pricing & Plans” to:
“View Packages & Rates”
Do not change the illustration or layout.
2) PROBLEM VS SOLUTION SECTION
Keep the headline and two-column layout as it is.
Below the two cards (“The Struggle” and “Our Solution”), add a short centered sentence and a small CTA button:
Text:
“Want to reduce your ticket backlog and response times?”
Button text:
“Talk to a CX Specialist”
Style the button to match the existing secondary buttons.
3) FEATURE GRID (“Everything You Need in an Outsourced CX Partner”)
Keep the existing 6 cards.
Add one more feature card in the grid about AI, so there are 7 items total (adjust layout sensibly on desktop and mobile).
New card:
Title: “AI-Assisted Efficiency”
Text: “Use AI for suggested replies, summaries and workflows to boost agent productivity.”
Icon: use a simple “spark” or “robot” style icon matching the other icons.
Under the “Tools We Work With” card, add a small row of tool logos or text labels (no need for real logos if not available, simple badges are fine):
Zendesk · Freshdesk · Intercom · Gorgias · Salesforce
4) METRICS STRIP (70% / 98% / 40% / 50k+)
Keep the current 4 metric blocks.
If there is space, add one more metric (optional, as a text-only placeholder):
Number: “40%”
Label: “Lower cost vs in-house teams (approx.)”
Make sure all metrics still fit nicely on one or two rows on mobile.
5) CASE STUDY SECTION
Keep the case study title and paragraph as they are.
Just above the quote, add a small “company label” line in a subtle style, for example:
“Client: US-based Online Travel Company (Name Confidential)”
Keep the testimonial quote as it is.
6) “HOW WE BUILD AND RUN YOUR SUPPORT TEAM” (4-step process)
Keep the 4 steps and timeline layout.
Under the section headline, add a one-line intro in slightly lighter text:
“Our proven onboarding framework helps you launch CX operations in days, not months.”
Keep the existing CTA button (“Start Your CX Journey with SaberTechs”) as is.
7) INDUSTRIES SECTION
Keep the 4 industry cards as they are.
In each card, make sure the text clearly starts with the typical type of support you provide, for example:
SaaS & Tech: “Onboarding, troubleshooting and product support for software companies.”
E-commerce & D2C: “Order status, returns, refunds and pre-sales queries.”
Travel & Hospitality: “Booking changes, cancellations and itinerary support.”
EdTech & Assessments: “Student queries, login issues and exam support.”
(If they already match this, no change needed.)
8) PRICING SECTION
Keep the 3 columns: Starter, Growth, Scale.
Under each plan name, add a small “ideal for” line in lighter text:
Starter: “Ideal for early-stage teams”
Growth: “Ideal for scaling CX operations”
Scale: “Ideal for 24/7 or multi-region support”
Below the three plans, just above the “Request Custom Pricing” button, add this short line in small text:
“Pricing is customized by agent count, coverage hours and channels. Transparent, no hidden fees.”
9) FAQ SECTION
Keep the existing FAQ questions.
Add two more questions at the bottom of the list:
“How does outsourced support reduce our costs?”
“Can you handle seasonal spikes and peak periods?”
You can reuse existing FAQ answer styles and keep answers short and clear.
10) FINAL CTA BANNER (“Ready to Build Your Customer Support Team?”)
Keep the headline, sub-text and button text as they are.
Under the main CTA button, add a small row of subtle text badges aligned center:
“Trusted by 50+ businesses” · “98% CSAT” · “Fast onboarding in as little as 7 days”
11) LIGHTWEIGHT CHATBOT ENTRY POINT (UI ONLY)
Add a small, fixed chat bubble in the bottom-right corner of the screen (desktop and mobile).
The bubble should use the same blue as the primary button and have a chat icon.
When clicked, it should open a small chat panel with:
Header title: “SaberBot”
Sub-text: “Ask us anything about CX outsourcing or pricing.”
Under that, a simple placeholder message like:
“Hi! 👋 I can help with your support requirements. What are you looking for?”
(You can leave the actual back-end / bot logic as a placeholder; just implement the UI and a dummy chat interface.)
