Please restyle the “Industries” dropdown menu so that it matches the same premium SaaS style as the improved “Services” dropdown.

Goal:
Both “Services” and “Industries” dropdowns should look visually consistent:
- Same container style
- Same fonts
- Same hover effect
- Same alignment under their menu label

1) NAV STRUCTURE (KEEP)
Keep these items in the navbar:
- Home
- Services ▾
- Industries ▾
- Why Us
- Contact
- Get a Quote

The “Industries” dropdown should contain these items in this order:
- SaaS & Tech
- E-commerce & D2C
- Travel & Hospitality
- EdTech & Assessments

Link targets (placeholder URLs are fine):
- SaaS & Tech → /industries/saas-tech.html
- E-commerce & D2C → /industries/ecommerce-d2c.html
- Travel & Hospitality → /industries/travel-hospitality.html
- EdTech & Assessments → /industries/edtech-assessments.html

2) CONTAINER STYLE
Match the styling of the Services dropdown container:

- Left-aligned directly under the “Industries” nav item.
- Max-width around 260–280px.
- Background: #ffffff
- Border-radius: 12px
- Box-shadow: something like 0 18px 45px rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.12)
- Internal padding: 16–20px
- Spacing between items: 10–12px
- Slight margin-top so it doesn’t touch the navbar.

3) ITEM STYLE
Each item should be a row with an icon + text, similar to Services:

- Small icon on the left (outline/line icon):
  - SaaS & Tech → monitor / code / app icon
  - E-commerce & D2C → shopping bag / cart
  - Travel & Hospitality → airplane / suitcase
  - EdTech & Assessments → graduation cap / book
- Icons should use the primary blue accent color.
- Text on the right:
  - Industry name, medium weight.
- No long descriptions, just clean labels.

4) HOVER EFFECT
Use the same hover style as Services:

- On hover:
  - Background: very light blue (#f3f6ff or similar)
  - Text color slightly darker
  - Cursor: pointer
- Icon may slightly darken or change shade on hover.

5) INTERACTION (DESKTOP)
- Dropdown opens on hover over “Industries”.
- Closes when the mouse leaves the dropdown area.
- Clicking directly on the word “Industries” (not a dropdown item) should go to the parent Industries page:
  /industries/index.html

6) INTERACTION (MOBILE)
- In the mobile / hamburger menu:
  - “Industries” should behave like “Services”: tap to expand/collapse a sub-menu.
  - Show all four items (SaaS & Tech, E-commerce & D2C, Travel & Hospitality, EdTech & Assessments) as sub-links.
- Make sure tap targets are large enough and spacing is comfortable.

7) CONSISTENCY
- Use the same font as the rest of the site (Inter / Poppins).
- Use the same blue accent and hover styles as the Services dropdown.
- Do NOT change the rest of the layout or any other sections; only restyle the Industries dropdown to visually match the Services dropdown.
