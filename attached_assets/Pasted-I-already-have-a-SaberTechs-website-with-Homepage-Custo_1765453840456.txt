I already have a SaberTechs website with:
- Homepage
- Customer Support & CX landing page
- Revenue & Inside Sales landing page
- Back Office Operations landing page

Using the SAME design system (fonts, colors, buttons, illustrations, spacing, layout), create a NEW landing page for:

👉 “Gig Workforce (On-Demand)”

❗ IMPORTANT:
This Gig Workforce page is ONLY for CLIENTS.
Remove ALL references to:
- “Join Our Gig Network”
- Gig workers applying
- Talent signup
- Forms for workers

We will create a separate “Careers / Join Our Gig Network” page later.

This page must be SEO + SEM friendly, fast, responsive, and consistent with existing SaberTechs pages.
