Build a modern, responsive, single-page Home website for a CX and Operations outsourcing company called “SaberTechs”.
Design style:
Clean, minimal, professional B2B layout.
Light theme with white background and blue accents.
Use large whitespace, clear sections, soft shadows, and rounded cards.
Visual style inspired by premium corporate multipurpose themes (enterprise SaaS / business consulting style), but make the design original.
Avoid cartoonish or childish illustrations. Use modern, abstract shapes and subtle gradients for banners.
Use a Google font such as Inter, Poppins, or Roboto.
The page structure must be:
TOP NAVBAR
Left: SaberTechs logo text (just “SaberTechs” in bold text for now).
Right: navigation links: Home, Services, Industries, Why SaberTechs, Contact.
A small “Book Consultation” button on the right.
Sticky navbar on scroll.
HERO BANNER (full width, premium, like a modern corporate theme)
Full-width section with a soft blue gradient background and abstract shapes in the corners.
Split layout: left side text, right side illustration.
Left side content:
Main headline (H1): “Customer Support & CX Teams for Growing SMBs”
Subheadline (H3): “Outsourced chat, email, voice, sales, back-office & gig operations — built for SaaS, E-commerce, Travel & EdTech.”
Two buttons side-by-side:
Primary (filled blue): “Book a Free Consultation”
Secondary (outlined): “Download Capability Deck”
Right side: a clean vector-style illustration or composition of cards showing chat bubbles, analytics, support agents, or dashboards. It should look like a premium business banner, not a generic stock photo.
