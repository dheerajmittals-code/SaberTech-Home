I already have a SaberTechs website with:
- A Homepage
- A “Customer Support & CX” landing page
- A “Revenue & Inside Sales” landing page

Using the SAME design system (fonts, colors, buttons, sections, spacing, hero style, cards, gradient CTA, FAQ accordion), create a NEW landing page for the service:

👉 “Back Office Operations”

This page must be:
- SEO-friendly and SEM (Google Ads) friendly
- Built with clean, responsive HTML/CSS (mobile-first)
- Using proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
- Fast-loading and easy to scan

Also:
- Add an SEO title + meta description
- Add internal links to other relevant SaberTechs pages (Customer Support & CX, Revenue & Inside Sales, QA & Compliance, AI Automation, Gig Workforce) where naturally relevant.

Use the following exact structure and content:

==================================================
1) HERO SECTION
==================================================

H1:
“Streamline Your Back-Office Operations — Without Growing Headcount”

Subheading:
“Product listings, data entry, refunds, catalog hygiene, order processing and CRM updates — handled by a dedicated back-office team from SaberTechs.”

Primary CTA button:
“Book a Free Ops Consultation”

Secondary CTA button:
“See Pricing & Plans”

Trust line under buttons:
“No long-term contracts · Scale up or down · Fast onboarding”

Below that, show a small horizontal list of trust metrics:
- “99%+ data accuracy”
- “24/7 coverage options”
- “Process playbooks & SOPs”
- “Dedicated Team Lead & QA”

Right side hero illustration:
Show a back-office operations team working with dashboards, spreadsheets, invoices, product catalogs and documents. Style must visually match the other illustrations on SaberTechs (blue 2D/3D style, clean and modern).

==================================================
2) PROBLEM → SOLUTION SECTION
==================================================

Section title (H2):
“Ops Team Overloaded? We Take Care of the Back Office Work.”

Layout:
Two side-by-side cards/columns, similar to the CX and Inside Sales “Struggle vs Solution” section.

LEFT CARD – Heading: “The Struggle”
Bullets:
- “Manual tasks slowing down your core team”
- “Catalog, orders and refunds taking too long”
- “Low data accuracy, duplicate or missing records”
- “No time to build proper SOPs and QC”

- “Costs increasing with seasonal volume spikes”

RIGHT CARD – Heading: “Our Solution”
Bullets:
